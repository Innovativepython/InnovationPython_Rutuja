1.Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of
them belongs to a different data type.
Ans:
# Integer type
a=1
type(a)

# Float type
b =2.01
type(b)

# string type
c = 'string'
type(c)

2.Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.
Ans:
# Complex type
a= 2+3j;
b=5
a,b=b,a
print(a)
print(b)

3. Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.
Ans:
# Swap the two numbers using third variable
x=1
y=2
temp=x
x= y
y= temp

# Same task without using third variable
x= 1
y= 2
x,y= y,x
print(x)
print(y)


4. Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x
Version.
Ans:
#In python 2.x version
a= int(raw_input("Enter any number: "))
# In python 3.x version
a= int(input("Enter any number: "))

5. Write a program to complete the task given below:Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 ,
 add the two numbers and keep the sum in another variable called z.
 Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the final output.
Ans:
print("Enter any number in range 1-10")
a= int(input("Enter any number: "))
b= int(input("Enter any number: "))
if a in range(1,11):
    if b in range(1,11):
        z= a+b
        result=z+30
        print(result)

6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc
Ans:
a=input("Enter any value: ")
print("The data type of the input value is :", type(eval(a)))


7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and UPPERCASE.
(Refer: https://capitalizemytitle.com/camel-case/)
Ans:
a='hello'
# Upper camelcase
print(a.title())
# lower camelcase
print(a.lower())
# snake case
print(a.lower())
# uppercase
print(a.upper())



8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
Ans: variables are labels for memory locations. It is used for storing the value. We can retrieve same value many
times. If we assigned new value to the same variable then it erases the old value for that variable.
 Fore.g.
a=4
type(a) # type of data is integer
a=3.5
type(a) # type of data is float.
